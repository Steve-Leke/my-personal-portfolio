                My name is Steve Leke and at the time of writing I am 14 years old.
                I'm currently a 9th grader attending Oakland Technical High School.
                I'm intrested in computer science and its potential effects on the future of our society.

                  Tech is soon to be the epicenter of tech. Everything from your job, to your car,
                  to your body will be revolutionized by tech. That is what I love about Tech.
                  The uses of tech are endless meaning opperunities to influence the industry are also endless.
                  With hard work and preseverance, lots of imagination, and a
                  little bit of luck, you can change yours and someone else's life overnight.

                  My biggest strength is my curiosity.
                  Iâ€™m always asking people questions whether it's about the world around us or their personal lives.
                  Being curious pushes me to explore ideas and methods that are deemed unconventional.
                  It allows me to have a deeper understanding of certain subjects.
                  My curiosity is one of the things I love about me.

                  I learned to code at Google Code Next.
                  What I love about Code Next is how they combine innovation that excites with community building.
                  At Code Next, there is no elitism or exclusiveness. Were all a bunch of kids going through similar experiences,
                  learning to become industry leaders together.

                  My biggest goal is to revive my home country of Cameroon.
                  Cameroon is not as technologically advanced as other countries such as America, China, Japan, and etc.
                  A big part of that is the dictator who rules Cameroon.
                  I hope to be able to bring services and build Cameroon into a 1st world country.
