      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        My name is Steve Leke and at the time of writing I am 14 years old.
        I'm currently a freshman or 9th grader attending Oakland Technical High School.

      <h3>What I love about tech?</h3>
      <p>
        Tech is soon to be the epicenter of tech. Everything from your job, to your car,
        to your body will be revolutionized by tech. That is what I love about Tech.
        The uses of tech are endless meaning opperunities to influence the industry are also endless.
        With hard work and preseverance, lots of imagination, and a
        little bit of luck, you can change yours and someone else's life overnight.

      <h3>What I love about Code Next?</h3>
      <p>
        What I love about Code Next is how they combine innovation that excites with community building.
        At Code Next, there is no elitism or exclusiveness. Were all a bunch of kids going through similar experiences,
        learning to become industry leaders together. "Industry leaders together" because Code Next opens you up to
        opportunities that are not only in Tech and your going through this wonderful experience with kids and coaches
        from all over the bay that have your back.
