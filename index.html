      <h2>What You Can't Tell By Looking At Me.</h2>
      <h2>By:Steve Leke</h2>
      <p class="poem">
      <p>What You Can’t Tell By Looking At Me Is I'm Different</p>
      <p>I Prefer To Play Soccer Over Basketball or Football</p>
      <p>I’m Super Competitive And Thinks Of Losing As Bad As Death</p>
      <p>I Play To Win and Will Always Play To Win</p>
      </p>
      <p class="poem">
      <p>What You Can’t Tell By Looking At Me Is I’m Different</p>
      <p>I Prefer To Go To School Than Not Go To School</p>
      <p>I Prefer To Learn About Abstract Ideas Than Just Do A Bunch Of Problems</p>
      <p>My Favorite Subject Is Computer Science Because It’s The Future</p>
      <p>Its Complexity Interests Me and Will Be A Vehicle To A Successful Career</p>
      </p>
      <p class="poem">
        <p>What You Can’t Tell By Looking At Me Is I’m Different</p>
        <p>I Love Fruits And Vegetables</p>
        <p>I Prefer Plantains Over Fries</p>
        <p>I Prefer BBQ Over Hamburgers</p>
        <p>I Prefer Anything Over Taco Bell</p>
      </p>

      <p class="poem">
      <p>What You Can’t Tell By Looking At Me Is I’m Different</p>
      <p>Even Though I’m Different You Shouldn’t Look At Me Different</p>
      <p>Even Though I’m Different You Shouldn’t Treat Me Different.</p>
      <p>Because…</p>
      <p>We’re All Different</p>
      </p>
